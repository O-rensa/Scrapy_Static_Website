She’ll be starting school. We’ll have to go clothes shopping with her. We’ll have open house and school festivals to go to.

Hey… (Nagisa Breathes heavily) Tomoya: Nagisa. You told me you’d always be by my side. You said, we’d always be together. You promised me that, remember? Over and over again. We both promised. That was my only dream. Nothing good ever happened to me until I met you. I thought I had a crappy life but even someone useless like me finally found something to live for. Right, Nagisa? Right? Nagisa… NAGISA!!!  Tomoya thinks of flashback when they first met: Nagisa's voice echoing in his head: Do you like this school? I have to say that I love it very very much! But soon, everything changes. Well, at least it does eventually. Fun things, happy things, they’ll all eventually change someday, you know. But, do you think you can still love this place anyway?

His intentions would be morally right by current philosophical standards on morality, but he was destroying members of humanity, which is not beneficial to those members. His intentions didn’t actually follow the duality, because although he intended for humanity to be heroic instead of greedy, he still had spite in himself, so part of his intentions were for the benefit of humanity, but the other part was not.
